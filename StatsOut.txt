My remit is for those who could be potentially studying at a minimum of a Further Educational level.  You might find that the paper covers many of the issues but it completely side-steps the issues when a student has a savere language difficulty or savere cognition problem...  I would need to go into talking about the appropriateness of content, symbolic communications. etc etc.  I do hope within the future to write a similar paper about web accessibility for those with hearing impairment (including pre-lingually deaf).  pete  &gt; Peter,  &gt; to clear up a possible confusion, can you confirm that you're use of SLD refers to specific learning difficulty or dyslexia, and not Severe Learning Difficulties or cognitive disability?  &gt; looks to be a great resource, we now link to it and http://www.techdis.ac.uk/seven/disability_and_the_web.html from http://www.learningdifferently.com/develop/papers.html where there are links to many other useful resources on LDD and the web  &gt; thanks  &gt; Jonathan"]

Jeffrey pledger <jpledger@mindspring.com> Melinda Morris-Black <melinda@ink.org> , Kynn Bartlett <kynn-hwg@idyllmtn.com> Actually, the government is not robbing us of our rights, but protecting us.  i know this sounds paradoxical, but it is true.  For any NOI (notice of inquiry), NPRM (notice of proposed rule making), etc. the government must follow the procedures established in the apa (i believe it is known as the Americans procedural Act) of 1947, which outlines the procedures of putting the NOI and NPRM out for comment for a specific time period.  The problem is that when they do this and get a large response to a particular NPRM, they (the government) is obligated to read each and every one of the \n responses, corrolate them and summarize them into specific response categories, if possible.  They do this with a limited staff.  This is not to say that i don\'t get frustrated either, but just an expalnation of the process.

Unfortunately once someone\'s site chooses a color you are stuck with it...  I am suggesting that an override be provided as an ACCESSIBILITY issue.

(This changes when images become a -requirement for accessibility-.) \n You do bring up a good point, however, that many people who can see are also not "visually capable" and may not be able to provide graphics easily.

Kasday <kasday@acm.org> w3c-wai-gl@w3.org > If we adopted a "use graphics" requirement as a P1, would a blind designer be able to meet that requirement effectively? \n There are lots of cases where a blind designer could use graphics as effectively, or actually more effectively, than a sighted person.  These are cases where the graphics are selected or generated in a rule based or standardized way.  For example, there are packages that generate flow charts from a textual description of a process.  These insure a sensible flow chart...  at least a chart that "parses" correctly.  On the other hand, I\'ve seen too many flow chart style diagrams by sighted people where I have trouble understanding what conventions if any they\'re using. I\'ll take a rule based design by a blind indivdiual any day. \n Other examples are graphs generated from data, schematic diagrams generated from pspice lists, and icons selected from a standardized set. \n Also, page layout and color selection can be made according to rules and standards. \n Now, what about more creatively artistic uses of design, uses that can\'t be reduced to mathematical or verbal rules?  Well, first of all that goes beyond our guidelines:  we\'re just looking at usability and I think rule-based graphics should handle that.  Second of all, I think there are certainly some blind individuals who can produce better art than some sighted individuals (better than me for example), certainly among people who have some vision and early visual experience.  As for art by people born blind... I\'m not familiar with that area but I woudn\'t be surprised there\'s some remarkable use of shape and form. \n -- \n Leonard R.

Excellent point -- the body of knowledge for disability access  considerations, beyond those of blind people (which are generally  well-explored these days), is pretty skimpy. We\'re -still- in the  exploration/discovery process of &quot;what works&quot;, and as we see more  solutions like Reef\'s -- which allow you to build an interface for  ONE audience without fearing interference with OTHER audiences\'  interfaces -- we will encounter more and more solutions which will  &quot;work&quot; for some people and &quot;not work&quot; for others.

My name is Daniel Dardailler and I work for W3C, acting as overall WAI Project Manager and also chair of the Evaluation&amp;amp;Repair working group (Len is chairing the Interest Group).  My involvement in Accessibility goes back to 1993 or so, when I started working on X Window Access.  I started at W3C in 1996 and helped starting and launching the WAI in 1997.  I think the work we're about to do in these two complementary ER groups is paramount to the success of the WAI.  Furthermore, I expect the ER IG to be instrumental in defining and refining the exact deliverables of the WG group. Al Gilman <asgilman@access.digex.net> w3c-wai-er-ig@w3.org Hi, I'm Al Gilman.  When I joined the dev-access list I said &quot;I'm a standards reformer, and I have an agenda.&quot;  Maybe that was a little in-your-face, and then maybe I am.  General background is at &amp;lt;http://www.access.digex.net/~asgilman/&amp;gt; .  I am wearing at least two hats in this particular context.  Under one hat I am chairing the WAI Protocols and Formats Working Group.  I think we need to have some empirical backup for protocol and format suggestions we make in the future.  So I am looking to this group to brainstorm some things to try, and the ER-WG to prototype some of them, so that we can be more confident of our recommendations.  Under another hat I am on the Trace Center team that will be supporting NSF NPACI webmasters with a toolkit strongly related to the results of the ER teams in the WAI.  This has led me to be talking with webmasters and web evaluators in the U.S. Federal Government, which is a business headquartered near where I live.  I have been talking up this group with those folks.

When I am not at AFB I live the life of a graduate student.  At the moment I am in the process of collecting data for my doctoral dissertation, which is basically a usability study of how users of speech interact with GUI elements.  In general, I am interested in adapting usability testing techniques so that individuals with disabilities can be included in assessments of mainstream technology, including the web.  Prior to joining AFB in the fall of 1993, I was a manager of evaluations at the federally funded rehabilitation engineering center on the evaluation of assistive technology.  Though our evaluations primarily focused on mobility related devices such as wheelchairs, scooters and bathroom equipment, I think the experience will prove useful to me in this endeavor.

I had some opportunity to work on universal design while I was at AT&amp;amp;T Bell Labs, e.g. designing the workstations at our Relay centers to accommodate communications assistants who are sighted, who use Braille, and who use a large screen and magnification.  I'm now at the Institute on Disabilities at Temple University in Philadelphia.  Also, I'm chair of this group.  (When you write about yourself please feel free to be a lot longer or shorter than I was.  Also, if your official job, i.e. your &quot;day&quot; job, isn't disability related, please mention it if you'd like to.  It can be very helpful to get a different perspective).  -------  Leonard R.

At ILRT, Caroline Meek, Dan and I have had discussions with a designer, and he has pointed us at some examples, and we've narrowed it down to two that we rather like: \n http://www.cadmium.co.uk/thumbs/brand%20x/maps%20and%20globes/t_bxp_c31027.jpg.jpg \n which has the advantage of showing Europe as part of the world (we could get rid of the arm of the globe that is showing, and alter the colours); \n and http://www.cadmium.co.uk/thumbs/ds/maps%20and%20globes/t_11407324.jpg.jpg \n which would be technically simpler to do, but shows Europe in isolation (I do like the colour scheme though). \n Do people have a preference for one style over the other? \n Could you let us know today if possible?  We need to specify the map as soon as possible in order to get postcards printed for www2003. \n thanks, \n Libby \n p.s.

This would be used by an author who is trying to repair accessibility problems in an existing PDF file.  The best analogy is that it is doing OCR on the logical strucure.  Like OCR technology, it is imperfect, and the results should be reviewed and corrected, if necessary, by the author. \n In Acrobat 5, this command was only available on Windows.  In Acrobat 6, it is available for both Mac and Windows. \n When the Adobe Reader 6.0 is presenting an untagged PDF file to assistive technology, it automatically runs MakeAccessible internally to infer logical structure.  This can make loading an untagged PDF considerably slower than loading a tagged PDF, but makes it possible, for example, to read tables even in an untagged PDF. \n Loretta', 'Doyle Burnett <dburnett@sesa.org> W3C Web Content <w3c-wai-gl@w3.org> Quick question.

I could *not* re-create the problem described when I tested this on my own system using MS Word 97 for Windows.  I followed the scenario with a simple test page (created in Netscape Page Composer) with a Heading, one line of text, and an image with ALT= text.  I opened the HTML file in Word97, added one word to the text of the Heading, then saved the file back to HTML with a new name.  The ALT= text was not affected.  MS Word 97, at least, seems to recognize HTML and preserve it.  Obviously, other versions of Word may behave differently.  I suspect that *any* word processor would strip the ALT= text if you first save the document in its *native* format, then try to save it back to HTML.

For any NOI (notice of inquiry), NPRM (notice of proposed rule making), etc. the government must follow the procedures established in the apa (i believe it is known as the Americans procedural Act) of 1947, which outlines the procedures of putting the NOI and NPRM out for comment for a specific time period.  The problem is that when they do this and get a large response to a particular NPRM, they (the government) is obligated to read each and every one of the \n responses, corrolate them and summarize them into specific response categories, if possible.

Kasday <kasday@acm.org> w3c-wai-gl@w3.org > If we adopted a "use graphics" requirement as a P1, would a blind designer be able to meet that requirement effectively? \n There are lots of cases where a blind designer could use graphics as effectively, or actually more effectively, than a sighted person.  These are cases where the graphics are selected or generated in a rule based or standardized way.  For example, there are packages that generate flow charts from a textual description of a process.  These insure a sensible flow chart...  at least a chart that "parses" correctly.  On the other hand, I\'ve seen too many flow chart style diagrams by sighted people where I have trouble understanding what conventions if any they\'re using. I\'ll take a rule based design by a blind indivdiual any day. \n Other examples are graphs generated from data, schematic diagrams generated from pspice lists, and icons selected from a standardized set. \n Also, page layout and color selection can be made according to rules and standards. \n Now, what about more creatively artistic uses of design, uses that can\'t be reduced to mathematical or verbal rules?  Well, first of all that goes beyond our guidelines:  we\'re just looking at usability and I think rule-based graphics should handle that.  Second of all, I think there are certainly some blind individuals who can produce better art than some sighted individuals (better than me for example), certainly among people who have some vision and early visual experience.  As for art by people born blind... I\'m not familiar with that area but I woudn\'t be surprised there\'s some remarkable use of shape and form. \n -- \n Leonard R.

My name is Daniel Dardailler and I work for W3C, acting as overall WAI Project Manager and also chair of the Evaluation&amp;amp;Repair working group (Len is chairing the Interest Group).  My involvement in Accessibility goes back to 1993 or so, when I started working on X Window Access.  I started at W3C in 1996 and helped starting and launching the WAI in 1997.  I think the work we're about to do in these two complementary ER groups is paramount to the success of the WAI.  Furthermore, I expect the ER IG to be instrumental in defining and refining the exact deliverables of the WG group. Al Gilman <asgilman@access.digex.net> w3c-wai-er-ig@w3.org Hi, I'm Al Gilman.  When I joined the dev-access list I said &quot;I'm a standards reformer, and I have an agenda.&quot;  Maybe that was a little in-your-face, and then maybe I am.  General background is at &amp;lt;http://www.access.digex.net/~asgilman/&amp;gt; .  I am wearing at least two hats in this particular context.  Under one hat I am chairing the WAI Protocols and Formats Working Group.  I think we need to have some empirical backup for protocol and format suggestions we make in the future.  So I am looking to this group to brainstorm some things to try, and the ER-WG to prototype some of them, so that we can be more confident of our recommendations.  Under another hat I am on the Trace Center team that will be supporting NSF NPACI webmasters with a toolkit strongly related to the results of the ER teams in the WAI.  This has led me to be talking with webmasters and web evaluators in the U.S. Federal Government, which is a business headquartered near where I live.  I have been talking up this group with those folks.

When I am not at AFB I live the life of a graduate student.  At the moment I am in the process of collecting data for my doctoral dissertation, which is basically a usability study of how users of speech interact with GUI elements.  In general, I am interested in adapting usability testing techniques so that individuals with disabilities can be included in assessments of mainstream technology, including the web.  Prior to joining AFB in the fall of 1993, I was a manager of evaluations at the federally funded rehabilitation engineering center on the evaluation of assistive technology.  Though our evaluations primarily focused on mobility related devices such as wheelchairs, scooters and bathroom equipment, I think the experience will prove useful to me in this endeavor.  I'm looking forward to working with the group.

This would be used by an author who is trying to repair accessibility problems in an existing PDF file.  The best analogy is that it is doing OCR on the logical strucure.  Like OCR technology, it is imperfect, and the results should be reviewed and corrected, if necessary, by the author. \n In Acrobat 5, this command was only available on Windows.  In Acrobat 6, it is available for both Mac and Windows. \n When the Adobe Reader 6.0 is presenting an untagged PDF file to assistive technology, it automatically runs MakeAccessible internally to infer logical structure.  This can make loading an untagged PDF considerably slower than loading a tagged PDF, but makes it possible, for example, to read tables even in an untagged PDF. \n Loretta': [8.242590009342948, 1.4828103113547815], 'Scarlett Julian (ED) <Julian.Scarlett@sheffield.gov.uk> \'Paul Davis\' <paul@ten-20.com> ,jon@hackcraft.net Please, this has nothing to do with web accessibility.

It\'s really easier to get to and has more night-life, etc etc etc.  A number of us have personal experience of the Edgewater\'s facilities from one of last year\'s ISC Meetings we had there. \n Very good site and lots of reasoably priced facilities in the area and Pikes Market Arcade Area is a hop, skip, and a jump away. \n Otherwise, by my vote - Sourthern California is fine by me. \n Todd \n ----- Original Message ----- \n > I\'ll check into that Peter : - ) \n > --Barb \n > -----Original Message----- \n >>> Has the decision been made, or should I express my preference for Seattle? \n >> Only if we can go to a certain shop, Barb knows what I am talking about :-) \n >> Peter \n >> --------------------------------- \n >> Dr. Peter Lipp \n >> IAIK, TU Graz \n >> Email Peter.Lipp@iaik.at \n >> Phone +43 316 873 5513 \n >> Fax +43 316 873 5510 \n >> Web http://jcewww.iaik.tu-graz.ac.at \n >> \n >>': [9.261898829365506, 2.0179707137415863], 'Liddy Nevile <liddy@motile.net> WAI AU Guidelines <w3c-wai-au@w3.org> I have submitted a request to hold this  - if we are successful we can decide how to do it and we do not need to go through papers submission etc .... \n Liddy': [4.037352865626737, 1.284603874832543], 'Poehlman, David <David.Poehlman@usmint.treas.gov> "\'Kynn Bartlett\'" <kynn-edapta@idyllmtn.com> ,love26@gorge.net anyone have a dictionary handy?': [3.5841117762241947, 1.2328300258792282], 'Patrick Burke <burke@ucla.edu> Michael Burks <mburks952@worldnet.att.net> All I get are the &quot;notify&quot; and &quot;beta tester&quot; links, which lead to forms to fill in the needed information.
